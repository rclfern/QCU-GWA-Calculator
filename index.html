    <h2>About the Website</h2>
    <p>
        Hey! This GWA Calculator was created to help the Quezon City University student community compute their 
        CUMULATIVE General Weighted Average more easily. Take note that It converts percentage grades 
        into the official numerical grading system then computes for the final grades 
        using midterm + final term, and automatically determines Passed/Failed status. Please remember that this online GWA calculator provides an estimate; your final grade may vary slightly from the official results issued by your instructor.

    <h3>About the Creator</h3>
    <p>
        I'm Rochele Fernandez, currently a Second Year student at the aforementioned university. First of all, this ABOUT Section is still under development as I made this in a rush but this whole thing has been my idea for seven months now. I developed this platform after experiencing firsthand the difficulty of manually computing my own academic progress. For a long time, I relied on various GWA calculators developed by students from other universities, but I often found them inconsistent with my own needs. This inspired me to create a more reliable, streamlined tool to help my fellow students manage their grades with confidence I haven't finished making my documentation on this project but feel free to check out my socials!:
